This repository is part of the course "MICROBIOME ANALYSIS USING 2ND AND 3RD GENERATION DNA SEQUENCING - 2023" (MAC2023) at the University of Copenhagen.

**The course GitHub pages**: [https://yanhui09.github.io/MAC2023](https://yanhui09.github.io/MAC2023)

As most bioinformatic software only have `linux/amd64` distribution, a `Linux/amd64` environment is recommended.

For cross-platform support including `MacOS`, we recommend using `docker`. Unfortunately, `arm64` platforms e.g., `Apple silicon` are not supported yet.
